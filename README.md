# 🎧 GenAI-Powered Customer Call Analytics & Agent Performance System

This project is an **end-to-end GenAI-powered call analytics system** that ingests customer support call recordings, analyzes them using **Google Gemini**, and provides **actionable insights** on both **customer issues** and **support agent performance**. 
The system is designed to mimic a **real-world enterprise workflow**, with structured data storage in **BigQuery** and **live analytics dashboards in Power BI**.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🎧 Audio Processing
- Upload customer support call recordings via a web UI
- Automatic upload to Google Cloud Storage
- Call duration computed deterministically from audio metadata

### 🧠 GenAI-Powered Analysis (Gemini)
- Full call transcription with speaker labeling
- Customer sentiment analysis
- Issue classification (Payment / Network / Recharge)
- Call resolution detection (Solved / Pending)
- Agent performance evaluation:
  - Agent tone assessment
  - Empathy score (1–5)
  - Clarity score (1–5)
  - Interruption behavior
  - Improvement suggestions
  - Overall qualitative feedback

### 🧍 Intelligent Agent Identification
- Extracts agent name if explicitly spoken during the call
- Falls back to filename-based identification (`AgentName-EmployeeID.ext`)
- Prevents guessing or hallucination of agent identities

### 🗄️ Enterprise-Grade Data Modeling
- Separate Customer and Employee tables
- Clean relational design using `customer_id` as a foreign key
- Timestamped records for analytics and auditing

### 📊 Live Analytics with Power BI
- BigQuery connected directly to Power BI
- Automatic refresh (no CSV downloads required)
- Interactive dashboards with slicers and KPIs

---

## 🧠 How Gemini Is Used

Gemini is used for **qualitative intelligence**, not for computing deterministic values.

### Gemini Responsibilities
- Call transcription with grammar correction
- Customer sentiment interpretation
- Agent tone and behavioral analysis
- Improvement suggestions and qualitative feedback generation

### Deterministic Processing
- Deterministic values such as **call duration** are **not inferred by AI**
- These values are calculated directly from audio metadata to ensure accuracy and reliability

---

## 📊 Power BI Dashboard

The Power BI dashboard is built on **live BigQuery connections** and provides real-time visibility into customer issues and agent performance.

### 🔹 KPI Overview
- Total Calls
- % Calls Resolved
- Average Empathy Score
- Average Clarity Score
- Average Call Duration

### 🔹 Call Insights
- Problem status distribution (Solved vs Pending)
- Problem type breakdown (Payment / Network / Recharge)

### 🔹 Agent Performance Analysis
- Agent-wise empathy and clarity scores
- Call duration vs clarity trends
- Qualitative agent feedback table generated using GenAI
- Interactive slicers (Agent, Year)

## ⚙️ Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file with the following variables  
(values are not shared for security reasons):

```env
BIGQUERY_PROJECT_ID=your-project-id
BIGQUERY_DATASET=your-dataset
BIGQUERY_TABLE_CUSTOMERS=your-customer-table
BIGQUERY_TABLE_EMPLOYEES=your-employee-table
GCS_BUCKET=your-bucket-name
GEMINI_MODEL=gemini-2.5-flash
GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS=path/to/service-account.json
```

⚠️ The `.env` file is intentionally excluded from version control.

## ▶️ Running the Project Locally

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

Then open:
```bash
http://localhost:8080
```

---

## 🔐 Security & Permissions

- Uses Google service account authentication  
- Vertex AI accesses audio via managed service agents  
- GCS access controlled using IAM roles  
- No secrets committed to GitHub  

---

## ⚠️ Current Limitations
- Supports pre-recorded calls only (no real-time streaming)
- No speaker diarization; a single support agent is assumed per call
- Agent identification depends on spoken name or filename-based fallback
- Sentiment analysis is summarized, not token-level or time-segmented

## 🔮 Future Enhancements
- Real-time call streaming and on-the-fly analysis
- Speaker diarization for multi-agent or transferred calls
- Agent identity confidence scoring
- Supervisor alerting for low-quality or high-risk calls
- Automated coaching and training recommendations
